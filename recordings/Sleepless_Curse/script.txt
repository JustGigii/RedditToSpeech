Sleepless Curse.
In the darkness of night,
a weary traveler stumbled upon an ancient book,
its worn pages whispering secrets of forbidden knowledge.
Ignoring the warnings,
the traveler greedily devoured its words.
As the clock ticked on,
sleep eluded the traveler,
replaced by haunting visions and maddening whispers that echoed through the lonely hours.
Madness took hold,
consuming the traveler's mind until all that remained was a sleepless shell,
forever trapped in the twisted grip of the cursed book's power
