How do you feel about prom?
Did you go?
Enjoy it?
.
I just finished my first prom and it went okay.
Asked out a lesbian to go with me before i knew she was lesbian.
Still went together and she's mad i didn't stay with her the whole time acting like I'm her man.
Wanted opinions or interesting stories since this is my first and last and didn't feel like i got enough out of it lol.
