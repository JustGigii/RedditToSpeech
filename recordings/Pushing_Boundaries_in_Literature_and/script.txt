Pushing Boundaries in Literature and Cinema - An Interview with Dapotheabstract.
Adedapo Adeniyi AKA dapotheabstract is a writer and filmmaker based in Ilorin,
Nigeria.
He explores abstractism through literature and cinema,
and believes he’s less of a person and more of a collection of ideas and metaphysical constructs.
 In this Intriguing interview with Iridescence he speaks about his journey into abstractism,
and how he’s able to interrelate his art with religion,
science and philosophy.
 We majorly spoke about film,
his life as an artist,
and abstractism as a whole.
