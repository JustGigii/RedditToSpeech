travel.
hi reddit question to those who have ever traveled alone,
how was it?
how to overcome the fear of traveling alone?
I’m planning a trip soon and everything seems to be fine,
but damn it’s so unusual that I want to cancel my tickets and stay at home; share your travel experience alone; how was it for you and did you feel any discomfort,
thanks
