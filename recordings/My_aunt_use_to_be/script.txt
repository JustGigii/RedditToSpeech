My aunt use to be friends with Keanu Reeves.
Basically I never knew this about my aunt until recently but she was friends with Keanu Reeves in the 80s.
She use to hang out with him and his friend in Toronto and they would play instruments together.
She told me she played the drums while Keanu and his friend played the guitar.
 She also told me that she had some dirt on him but she wouldn’t specifically tell me what it was.
 Can’t believe my aunt was friends with one of my favourite actors lol.
