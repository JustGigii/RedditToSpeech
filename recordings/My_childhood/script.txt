My childhood.
As a child,
I found myself left alone at home very often.
In order to pass the time faster,
I delved into my imagination and began to create elaborate tales about anything that popped into my head.
I would envision myself as the protagonist,
a character named Jamis,
who embarked on thrilling adventures throughout the fantastical world of Alkamyr.
Drawing inspiration from my own life experiences,
I still write these stories to this day,
and now,
I feel it's finally time to share them.
