Venting,
 not sure if this is the correct sub.

I’ll get to the point,
 I’m a guy and at times I cry.
  I’m happily married,
 we have a beautiful healthy daughter,
 we both have good jobs.
  I tear up at times,
 when I see kids with special needs that have so much to  deal with.
  (And the parents,
 they can be so inspiring the commit they give) My wife and daughter always say we never see you cry….
 (Not true.
 ) I’m an open book.
  I just wanted to get this off my chest… Thanks!
