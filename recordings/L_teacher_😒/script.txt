L teacher ğŸ˜’.
Today I had a test in social studies I got everything correct but I asked her what was wrong she told me that I wrote Persian gulf and she said it was called the Arabian gulf (For people who donâ€™t understand it was first called the Persian gulf since 550 bc but then the Arabian countryâ€™s said that we want to call it Arabian gulf)and this test will affect my grades ğŸ˜’ğŸ˜’
